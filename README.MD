# Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app, practicing known and exploring new technologies (see above). I learned these new tools independently by reading its documentation, consultin forums like StackExchange and watching online videos.

- practice full-stack app development
- build a working prototype in 2 weeks
- apply what we learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp
- extend with new technology independently
- showcase and document development skills using:
- wireframes as Minimum Viable Product
- conscious data model design
- user stories perspective
- agile/kanban project approach
- transparant and structured git version control

# User stories

- as a user I want to be able to create an account
- as a user I want to be able to login
- as a user I want to be able to view all products available per store
- as a user I want to be able to add products to my cart & place an order
- as a user I want to be able to view all added products on my order details page before checkout
- as a user I want to be able to checkout and pay for my products
- as a user I want to be able to track my order
